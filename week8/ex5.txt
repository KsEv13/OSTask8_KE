Physical address: The address where something is physically located in the RAM chip.
Virtual address: The address which the program uses to achieve its goals and the CPU uses 
to retrieve the data. It is not real and is converted to a physical address via the MMU 
(basically even the processor doesn't know about this conversion). May be outside of 
physical RAM.
